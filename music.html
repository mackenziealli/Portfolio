          <strong>What is this?</strong><br>
          A music application I designed independently for COGS 187A: Usability & Information Architecture.<br><br>
          
          <strong>The Process</strong><br>
          Interviews | Comparisons | Competitive Analysis | Design<br><br>
          I interviewed various people on the music application of their choice. I inquired about the playlists they create, 
          their favorite things about the application, and any problems they have experienced with it. I found that convenience is a very 
          large factor in what application people choose to use -- the application that comes with the phone has a definite leg 
          up. The next biggest factor was the number of features offered. Users particularly enjoyed applications that offered 
          them everything they could possibly want, allowing a varied musical experience. Small details tended to be a big issue 
          with users; applications that didn't constantly allow them a way to keep track of what they were doing and undo mistakes 
          ended up causing frustration.<br><br>
          I compared the three applications that were used among my pool of interviewees. I examined how a user would go about 
          performing three specific scenarios on each application: creating a playlist, managing a playlist, and searching for 
          music. The best applications had a conventional and therefore intuitive process that made multiple actions available in 
          one place.<br><br>
          My competitive analysis compared the navigational structures of the three applications: What categories were listed on the 
          icon bar? Where did each of those categories lead to? Additionally, I compared the "Genres" offered by each application. 
          This allowed an interesting analysis of not only what subcategories each application chose to include, but the vocabulary 
          used in their lists. I found that while all of the applications had clearly labelled sections on their main navigation bar, 
          the sections thereafter lacked order or consistency, and were sometimes just startlingly random.<br><br>
          I designed my application with the goal of creating something modern and appealing, but also intuitive and easy to get from 
          section to section and perform or abort actions. The defining design decisions of my project that I put the most thought into 
          are the icon bar, the usage and placement of back buttons, and the color scheme.
